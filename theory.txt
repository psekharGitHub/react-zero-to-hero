What is ReactJS

Open source Javascript library for building user interface

Why to learn ReactJS ?

Component Based Development
------------------------------
Component Based Development means designing our software applications
by building loosely coupled independent components

What is Component ?
----------------------
A comoponent is a well-defined and independent piece of our app's user
interface
ex. buttons, header, footer, navigation, table, pagination


Why do we need components ?
-----------------------------
 - because ReactJS updates DOM(Document Object Model) periodically
 - built off of the concept of Ajax Requests, in which calls are 
   made directly from client-side, allowing for the DOM to be
   priodically updated without the need of 'page refresh'

 - because components are independent, one component can refresh without
   affecting other components or the UI as a whole

 - DOM - whatever you see in the browser i.e., whatever present inside
         the <body> </body>
   
   Types of components
   --------------------
   1. Functional components - create components using function
   2. Class components - create components using class

   React JS Basics
   ====================
   props - we use props to allow components to talk to eachother
   
   state - ReactJS updates UI based on the application state
         - this is actually stored as a property of Reach Class Component

   Packages
   -------------------------
   By default react has 4 Packages
    - react
    - react-dom
    - react-scripts
    - web-vitals

    Starting file
    --------------------
    - index.js is the starting file
    - but actually, what you type in App.js is what appers on the page
